For this module you need Arduino Uno and 12 LED in 3 different colors, example:
red, yellow and green, for 4 LEDs in each color.
LEDs of each color must alternate every 2 LEDs another color.
Anode of each LED MUST be connect with digital pin (2-13) of Arduino via resistor at 220 Ohm!
Else your LED can be damaged!!!
Cathode of each LED need connect with GND of Arduino.
